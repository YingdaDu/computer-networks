# 1 One common implementation for a virtual private network solution utilizes PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunnelling Protocol).  It now hasmany issues related to the way it authenticates users.  Write firewall policy rules to block PPTP that will prohibit all systems fromaccessing a PPTP server running on server2.  (TCP Port 1723)

# 2 SSH is used to provide a remote shell which can be used to forward other ports or to bypass firewalls.  Write firewall policy rule(s)that will prohibit all computers/devices from connecting to a SSH server on the east hosts (e1-e3).   (TCP and UDP Port 22)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell)

# 3 One common way to perform a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack is to use an amplification attack using the Network TimeProtocol (NTP) and Domain Name Services (DNS) taking advantage of the UDP protocol to saturate the links.  Write firewall policyrule(s) to protect the DNS and NTP  Services on server1 and server2 from all hosts.  However, the DNS and NTP services on server3should remain accessible. (UDP Ports 123 and 53, respectively)

# 4 Write a series of firewall policy rules disallowing hosts w1 and w2 from pinging mobile1.  This rule will be satisfied if the full ICMPresponse is not completed.  Analyzing the interactions with Wireshark is helpful, but not required.

# 6 Write a series of firewall policies to restrict host mobile1 from communicating to any of the east hosts (e1-e3) on both TCP and UDPprotocols.
